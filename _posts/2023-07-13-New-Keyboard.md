# Narcissistic and mostly unnecessary intro
Since hitting my 40s it feels like the warranty on my body has run out. There are the occasional random pains of "How did I hurt myself sleeping?!" and then there are the bulging and herniated disks in my back. I am at the age where I have to change the way that I think, move, and unconsciously move. One of the issues I face daily is fatigue in my forearms and trigger thumb. According to the Mayo Clinc, trigger finger “Trigger finger makes a finger get stuck in a bent position. It may straighten suddenly with a snap. The fingers most often affected are the ring finger and the thumb, but the condition can affect any finger. Trigger finger happens when the tendon that controls that finger can't glide smoothly in the sheath that surrounds it. This may occur if part of the tendon sheath becomes swollen or if a small lump forms on the tendon.” And it doesn’t just snap back. It’s a painful snap.
## The journey with ergonomics
While discussing this with my wife, Cindie, and my chiropractor they suggested that I try a new mouse and keyboard. Since I spend 8-10 hours a day at my desk its always important for me to consider ergonomics. This has read me down a new journey. First I started with a new mouse.  A long time ago someone introduced me into the concept of ergonomics and show me my first ergonomic mouse. Your normal mouse does not take into consideration your body and how it works. We are simply forced to do as it commands and hold it according to its specifications. My mind was blown when I got my first Evoluent Vertical Mouse 4. This bad boy was awesome, and I used it for about a decade. The vertical mouse takes into consideration that when I am at a desk my natural arm position is to have my wrist on the side, but you still have to do the same arm movements. I now have my first trackball mouse.
Now that I have corrected my mouse issue the next step is to update my keyboard. I’ve used the normal full-sized keyboard for many years like everyone else. Around 2009 when I started at a web hosting company, I occasionally landed at a desk that had the Microsoft Natural Ergonomic keyboard. This was my first experience with a split keyboard. I really enjoyed using the keyboard and it makes sense from an ergonomic stance when you think about where your arms are when your hands are on the keyboard. I used this keyboard for about 5 or 6 years and replaced it a couple of times and it was about $75. This keyboard dazzled people since it looked so different, but that was nothing when they saw my next keyboard. I worked next to a guy that used the Kinesis Advantage2 and this keyboard was like nothing I had ever seen. Not only was it a split mechanical keyboard, but it also had a well for the keys. I mocked the poor guy because of the monstrosity that was on his desk. When he went out of town for two weeks he challenged me to try it. After those two weeks I was hooked. I liked the feel of the key well and the feel of a mechanical keyboard. I used that keyboard for years and only replaced  once.  Honestly I thought was going to be my last keyboard. Once I knew that I would be getting something new the ADHD hyper focus began. I knew that I wanted something ergonomic but I wasn’t ready to commit to the keyboards with only 16-20 keys, Though I do see a 34 or 36 key Keyboard in my future. That is when I found the Iris rev7 from Keeb.io. It's a split keyboard, which means it is in two pieces and it is ortho linear, which means the keys are in a straight line and not staggered. Both of these things are and attempt to be more ergonomic. I'm a big dude so it's easier for me to have my keys on the left and right separated a lot more than your standard keyboard does. It's ortho linear because there's less stress on my fingers just going up and down than if they have to travel from side to side as well. I know that most people don't even think about the keyboard that they use when they work. It's like people who have only driven cars from the 70s and are fine with just getting from point A to point B. The thing is, once you've driven a Cadillac Escalade or a Tesla Model S you see the world differently.

## The Keeb setup
Even though I know most won't care, I can tell you that I'm using YMDK PBT, blank, DSA profile key caps (other than a few fun random ones) on a perfectly clicky Kailh White Owl switch which has a nice click bar and an actuation force of 70g. The keyboard came with silent shrimp switches, but for some reason silent keyboard hurts my soul. I tried a few different tactile and linear switches, including a clone of the holy pandas and the glorious pandas, but they just don't do it for me. There's something inside me that feels that every keystroke is an accomplishment when I hear and feel that little click and feedback. Do I sort of wish the was way to make the click sound a bit deeper and more “thoccy”? Sure, but I haven’t found that deep clicky switch yet. While I don’t have co-workers in the next cubicle over that will complain, I do share my office with my two boys. We'll see how long it takes them to complain about daddy's keyboard sounds.

# Why a different keyboard layout?
So, now on to the interesting part of this post. Most people in the world that have a standard English keyboard are using the QWERTY layout. It was designed in the 1800s and while some say that it was designed to separate the most hit keys to ensure the typewriter didn't jam, I think that has been debunked as urban legend. Despite that urban legend being debunked, I thought it was a valid investigation to find out if another keyboard layout would truly make a difference. What follows below is my own little research into keyboard layouts. I found a script online that showed how much finger movement was required for a given keyboard layout. Here is an example with the short sentence.

What we see here when we look at the “Finger Movement” column is that the QWERTY layout requires your fingers to travel more than the other layouts. In this sentence we can see that the Dvorak layout uses the least amount of movement of the fingers because you have to leave the home row of keys. While I do write emails and some chat messages, the bulk of my work is writing code. So I gathered the top 30 Python projects from GitHub and ran my script to see if the same results would present themselves.
