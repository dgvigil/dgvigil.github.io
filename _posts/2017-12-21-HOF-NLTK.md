So, I've been super interested in Data Science and heading down the road of
expanding my knowledge in Sabermetrics as well.  I've been playing alot with
my new obsession, Machine Learning. This has all been able to combine pretty
well.  The latest thing to learn has been Natural Language Processing. Wikipedia
defines it as:
Natural language processing (NLP) is a field of computer science, artificial
intelligence concerned with the interactions between computers and human
(natural) languages, and, in particular, concerned with programming computers
to fruitfully process large natural language data.

My father got his degree in Lingustics and I grew up in a home where the
"Encyclopedia of Language and Linguistics" was on the bookshelf and within my reach.
This field seems like a fun bridge.  Again tieing in my childhood, I was
surrounded by baseball or 'the church of baseball' as it is referred to by
Annie Savoy.  The following is my learning some NLP with a baseball twist.

FUN, no?!

So I plan to do a bit more with Python and/or R to show some sabermetrics.
Since I may have a bit of free time over Christmas I'll try to add more.
