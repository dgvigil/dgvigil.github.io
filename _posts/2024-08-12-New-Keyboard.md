# Narcissistic and mostly unnecessary intro
Turning 40 is often seen as a milestone—a moment of introspection where one evaluates not just life’s achievements, but the body that has carried them. For many, this age marks the beginning of new aches and unexplained pains, the kind that make one ponder, "How did I hurt myself sleeping?" But for some, like myself, it’s a wake-up call that forces a reexamination of the very ways in which we move, sit, and work.
<br>
Among these new physical challenges are the recurring fatigue in my forearms and the painful phenomenon known as trigger thumb. According to the Mayo Clinic, trigger finger occurs when a finger gets stuck in a bent position, often straightening suddenly with a painful snap. This condition results from the tendon controlling the finger not gliding smoothly due to swelling or a small lump on the tendon. It’s more than just an inconvenience—it’s a painful reminder that our bodies are complex machines that require careful maintenance.

# A Deep Dive into Ergonomics
My journey into the world of ergonomics began with a conversation. Both my wife, Cindie, and my chiropractor suggested that I rethink the tools I use daily—starting with my mouse and keyboard. As someone who spends 8 to 10 hours a day at a desk, I knew this was advice worth taking seriously. What followed was an ADHD-fueled deep dive into the science of ergonomics, a field that has become increasingly crucial in our modern, desk-bound lives.
<br>
Ergonomics, derived from the Greek words for “work” and “natural laws,” is the study of how to optimize tools and environments for human use. The goal is to reduce discomfort and the risk of injury, particularly in the workplace. According to a report by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), musculoskeletal disorders, often caused by poor ergonomics, account for nearly 33% of all worker injury and illness cases. The significance of ergonomic tools cannot be overstated, as they are designed to fit the user's body, rather than forcing the user to adapt to the tool.

## The Mouse Evolution
Years ago, I was introduced to ergonomics through a colleague who demonstrated the importance of a well-designed mouse. Traditional mice, which most of us use without a second thought, require the hand to be in a position that is not natural for the human body. The wrist is forced into an unnatural alignment, which can lead to strain over time. My first ergonomic mouse, the Evoluent Vertical Mouse 4, was a revelation. This vertical mouse allowed my wrist to maintain a more natural position, with the hand resting on its side rather than flat on the desk. A 2015 study published in the Journal of Occupational Rehabilitation confirmed that vertical mice significantly reduce pain in the wrist and forearm compared to traditional models.
<br>
However, while the vertical mouse addressed the position of my wrist, it did not eliminate the need for arm movement. Recently, I made the switch to a trackball mouse, which further minimizes the amount of movement required. Trackball mice allow the user to control the cursor with a simple thumb or finger movement, keeping the arm stationary. This seemingly small change has had a profound impact on reducing the overall strain on my arm.

## A New Keyboard Horizon
With the mouse issue addressed, my focus turned to the keyboard—a tool I have relied on for decades. The standard full-sized keyboard, with its staggered keys and compact design, is ubiquitous. Yet, like the traditional mouse, it fails to take the body’s natural positioning into account. My first foray into ergonomic keyboards began in 2009 with the Microsoft Natural Ergonomic Keyboard. This keyboard featured a split design that allowed my arms to stay in a more relaxed, natural position while typing. The split keyboard concept is backed by research; a study published in Ergonomics found that split keyboards can reduce the risk of developing musculoskeletal disorders by allowing the arms to remain in a more neutral position.
<br>
But the journey didn’t stop there. A few years later, a colleague introduced me to the Kinesis Advantage2—a keyboard that, at first glance, seemed more like a futuristic contraption than a typing tool. This split mechanical keyboard not only separated the keys but also placed them in concave wells, designed to match the natural curvature of the fingers. Initially, I mocked this design, but after accepting a challenge to use it for two weeks, I was hooked. The concave wells and mechanical switches offered a typing experience that was not only more comfortable but also more satisfying, with each keystroke delivering a tactile response that made typing a joy rather than a chore.
<br>
The science behind mechanical keyboards, particularly those with tactile switches, is well-documented. Research published in the International Journal of Human-Computer Interaction has shown that the tactile feedback provided by mechanical keyboards can reduce typing fatigue, as the distinct actuation point of each key reduces the likelihood of bottoming out—where a key is pressed too hard, causing strain.

# The Iris Rev8: A New Era of Typing
As I continued my exploration, I discovered the Iris rev8 from Keeb.io—a keyboard that pushes the boundaries of ergonomic design. This keyboard is split into two separate halves, allowing for a custom layout that matches the width of my shoulders. What’s more, it features an ortho-linear layout, where the keys are aligned in a straight grid rather than the traditional staggered rows. This design is intended to reduce finger movement and strain, as the fingers only need to move up and down, rather than diagonally.
<br>
The ortho-linear layout, though uncommon, is gaining traction among those who spend long hours typing. According to a study in Applied Ergonomics, reducing the lateral movement of the fingers on a keyboard can significantly decrease muscle strain and increase typing efficiency. The straight grid layout of the Iris rev7 is designed with this principle in mind, aiming to minimize unnecessary finger travel.
<br>
While the benefits of these ergonomic improvements are clear, the choice of materials and switches also plays a crucial role in the overall typing experience. My Iris rev7 is equipped with PBT material XDA profile keycaps, known for their durability and resistance to shine, ensuring that the keyboard remains comfortable and visually appealing even after prolonged use. The Kailh White Owl switches I selected are clicky and tactile, with an actuation force of 70g. This choice reflects my preference for a keyboard that provides clear, audible feedback with each keystroke—a feature that not only enhances the typing experience but also gives a sense of accomplishment with every keypress.
<br>
Although my family may not share my enthusiasm for the clicky switches—particularly my wife, who finds the noise less than ideal—my youngest son has adopted the same switches for his keyboard, sharing in the delight of each satisfying click.
<br>

# Rethinking the Keyboard Layout
The final frontier in my ergonomic journey was the keyboard layout itself. Most people use the QWERTY layout, a design that has been the standard since the 1800s. The origins of QWERTY are often attributed to the need to prevent typewriter jams by spacing out frequently used keys, but this theory has largely been debunked. Despite its historical significance, QWERTY is not necessarily the most efficient or ergonomic layout for modern typists.
<br>
Intrigued by the possibility of improving my typing efficiency and reducing strain, I decided to investigate alternative layouts. I came across a script that analyzes finger movement for different keyboard layouts, and the results were eye-opening. For instance, the Dvorak layout, which places the most commonly used keys on the home row, requires significantly less finger movement than QWERTY. This reduction in movement is not just a theoretical improvement; a study published in Human Factors found that Dvorak users experienced less fatigue and maintained higher typing speeds over longer periods compared to QWERTY users.

What we see here when we look at the “Finger Movement” column is that the QWERTY layout requires your fingers to travel more than the other layouts. In this sentence we can see that the Dvorak layout uses the least amount of movement of the fingers because you have to leave the home row of keys. Given that my work involves writing code—where precision and efficiency are paramount—I extended this analysis to include a sample of the top 30 Python projects from GitHub. The findings were consistent: layouts like Dvorak and Colemak required significantly less finger movement, suggesting that they could reduce strain and improve typing efficiency over time. For someone who spends hours at a keyboard, the potential benefits of switching to a more ergonomic layout are compelling.

## Conclusion: The Pursuit of Ergonomic Perfection
As I continue to refine my setup, from the tools I use to the way I use them, I am reminded that ergonomics is not just about comfort—it’s about preserving the body’s functionality over time. In a world where the average office worker spends thousands of hours at a desk each year, the importance of ergonomic design cannot be overstated. The changes I’ve made, from adopting a vertical mouse to experimenting with alternative keyboard layouts, are small steps in the larger pursuit of a healthier, more sustainable way of working.
<br>
Whether or not these changes will completely alleviate the issues I’ve been experiencing remains to be seen. But what is clear is that the journey toward finding the right tools for the job—tools that fit my body rather than forcing my body to fit them—is one worth taking. And who knows? Perhaps this new keyboard layout really will be the key to a new me.
